# Global Rules (Developer Workday)

## Repo awareness
- JavaFX Desktop application: developer-workday

## Verification rules
- When acceptance criteria mention UI, verify through unit and integrations tests

## “Done” definition
A task is done when:
- Its acceptance criteria are met.
- Tests exist and pass.
- `project-tasks.json` has `passes=true` for that task.
- A clean commit has been created.
